# Why are you interested in Experian?
i know that people are struggling with financial success, and expeirance are helping them to save on car insurance, and have good estimation on their credit scor , and i think those are noble mission and i want to join to help built such a great future for the people! 

Moreover, i have been a huge fan with financial technology and i know the importance of data drive insights in this category. for example
During my time  at CICC, I built a real-time dashboard for monitoring service expediture and usage, it helped the firm detect spending anomalies and save them up to 10K usd per month.

The experience made me realize how powerful data-driven insights can be. I’m particularly drawn to the Experian’ s innovation in AI and analytics, and I’d love to contribute my skills in data systems and Ai agent to projects that make a real impact to people’s lives.”

# Tell us about a time you demonstrated a key skill or solved a difficult problem.
During my internship at Midas Analytics, our financial market intelligence platform was experiencing performance issues due to heavy data loads. I took the initiative to redesign the MongoDB data layer, collaborating closely with data and machine learning engineers to transform the protobuf schemas into more efficient formats.

On the application backend, I replaced the Mongoose ODM with the native MongoDB driver and optimized aggregation pipelines, which cut query latency by 50% under high concurrency.

This experience demonstrates my ability to collaborate effectively within a team, identify performance bottlenecks, and apply sound engineering approaches to deliver impactful, scalable solutions.

# What skills or qualities would you bring to Experian?
I bring a combination of full-stack engineering, data infrastructure, and AI workflow design experience. I’ve developed systems using Python, Node.js, SQL, and AWS to build scalable and secure platforms. 

For instance, during my internship at Hong Kong Telecom, I built an internal GenAI platform using LangChain and RAG pipelines, which supported over 20 internal teams with enterprise-grade access to LLMs. That experience strengthened my ability to design modular, production-ready architectures that balance performance, scalability, and data privacy etc

On the frontend, I’ve delivered user-centric and performant interfaces using React.js, I ensure complex data systems remain intuitive and responsive for end users. I enjoy bridging the gap between backend logic and real-world usability

I also value collaboration and cross-functional teamwork. At university and in startups, I’ve led small developer teams, coordinated version control with Git and CI/CD pipelines, and mentored peers in code reviews. These experiences taught me how to balance technical rigor with clear communication.
