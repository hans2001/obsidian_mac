Problem: 
You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (**0-indexed**),

- If the current building's height is **greater than or equal** to the next building's height, you do **not** need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is **less than** the next building's height, you can either use **one ladder** or `(h[i+1] - h[i])` **bricks**.

_Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally._

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/27/q4.gif)

**Input:** heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
**Output:** 7

**Example 3:**
**Input:** heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 106`
- `0 <= bricks <= 109`
- `0 <= ladders <= heights.length`

failure: 
future knowledge is not needed, did not have the correct mental model ,where we can use one side first, and make way for the other methods at the proper time!( still have  brick)
using heap dynamically, where it gave us additional info on sorting the delta cost and use brick to cover the lower delta! 

Intuition:
assume we use ladder al the time ,when ladder ran out ,we try to use brick to cover fr the smallest delta we have met (locally smallest!). when both ladder and brick ran out, we know that we cannot move forward anymore! 

Solution:
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(
        self,
        heights: List[int],
        bricks: int,
        ladders: int
    ) -> int:
        min_heap = []

        for i in range(1, len(heights)):
            climb = heights[i] - heights[i - 1]

            if climb <= 0:
                continue

            # Tentatively use a ladder for this climb
            heappush(min_heap, climb)

            # If we used more ladders than available,
            # replace the smallest ladder usage with bricks
            if len(min_heap) > ladders:
                bricks -= heappop(min_heap)
                if bricks < 0:
                    return i - 1

        return len(heights) - 1
```
