## Hirevue
**Tell me something interesting about yourself that isn't on your CV**

During my college years, i became very interested in technology, and i spent a lot of time trying to get in some of the clubs. for example, i tried hard to get into the robotics team, i spent a lot of time working on their assignments and their enrollment competition, yet i failed due to my inability to balance the work there and my course assignments. 

Anyway, i was able to join another organization called USTHING, where we built software to improve student campus life, in my senior years, i managed to be promoted to technical Lead, where I led the team to build features that empower students to exchange their academic materials.

Even though i failed to get into the robotics team, i was particularly proud of the experience and would like to share it with you

Since I believe it is always cool to try hard for something that we want!! regardless of failure or success

**Why do you want to work in this division at BlackRock?**
I have always been a technologist and am comfortable with learning and applying new technologies, that is why i think joining the software engineering division would be the best possible way for me to contribute to BlackRock.

Moreover, from what i saw on the blackrock website, the unit is known for people who come from diverse background and share a passion for utilizing GenAI to empower the company's products. I believe I will gain a lots of exposure in this unit and be able to contribute to the team well, since i fulfill most of the capabilities the unit is looking for , and i share the same passion for GenAI technologies!

**Why do u want to work at BlackRock**
it is rare that a financial institution does not serve a particular privileged group, but rather chooses to help everyone to build a great financial future. The vision touches me, and i believe it is really valuable for professionals at BlackRock to advise people like me, who know little about the financial markets, but are afraid of missing out on market opportunities. 

From what i have heard
BlackRock is also a major player in fintech, the Aladdin platform is a major source of income for blackRock, and the firm provides related technologies to other financial firms as well. Therefore, I believe my work here will have a large impact and i will have a lot of growth working at blackrock.

Finally
The blackRock principles also largely aligns with my values and beliefs, i believe i will fit well in the company and able to contribute to the technological division, given my expertise in technology!

**Name a time you overcame adversity**
During my first internship, i was tasked with building a mobile app using the framework react-ionic. Even though I have fundamentals in programing, I have little experience on the type of tools and practice that was used by the industry, so the amount of knowledge to consume at the time was overwhelming . To make it worse, the CTO expect me to deliver a unreasonable amount of code each day, which makes me more nervous and could not learn properly! 

What I did to overcome this adversity is that i had a serious conversation with the CTO, telling him that i need more time to pick up things properly at the initial phase, and I promised him that i will pick up the pace and put us back on track later.  Even though his was in doubt, he did carve out a period where i can focus more on learning and understanding the codebase. in the end, I managed to delivered as i promised, he is satisfied with the result, and even invited me to be a part time employee.

That is where i learned the importance of communication and not to failed other's  trust!

**what is your biggest weakness**
my biggest weakness is probably sometimes the obsession to overEngineer a solution , and it might delay the progress occasionally. As an engineer, we all know that technical debt is bad, and they hurt us in the long run. Along with that, i personally have an interest in optimizing systems and software to the best they could reach, sometime the changes might be minor or not even the performance bottleneck, but i would go the extra mile to do that optimization.  As i gain more experience working in team and commercial environments, I learned to strike a balance between refactoring and pushing new features, and i learn to appreciate done over perfect! 

**Describe a time where you had to explain something difficult to someone non-technical**
i do have this sort of experience where i have to introduce the work i have done in last internship to an hiring manager. The situation was obviously testing my communications skills, and what i did was to decouple the complex system i built to couple major components, and explain what each component does and how they are connected together. The method did gave clarity to the system i built, and i even utilize the STAR principle to explain the context of why we have to build that, what exactly i did and what kind of result my actions led to, and with the additional context, i believe the system can be understood quite intuitively, similar to how we connect difficult concepts to things we already know! 

**How would you learn a new technology that you need to use for the job?**
First i would make sure i understand the terminology that is used by this new technology, similar to how we learn a new language, we learn the vocabulary first before connecting things together. Then i would understand the core concepts that the technology introduced ,and finally i would get my hands dirty, where i actually use the technology to build something, so that i can have a more profound understanding of that, or know how we can practically use that in our project, instead of wasting time learning everything! 

**What are the 5 principles of BlackRock?**
The **first** principle is to be a fiduciary to our client , where our client's interest always comes first, and it promotes giving unbiased advice to clients. 

**Second** is to work collaboratively with colleagues, in order to create the best outcomes for out clients and communities. 

**Third** is to be passionate about performance, where we should relentlessly find ways to serve our clients and improve our firm.

**Fourth** is to take emotional ownership, which means we should feel a deep sense of responsibility to our clients. 

**Final one** is to commit to a better future, it encourages us to think long term and to run the firm with sustainable and responsible decisions! 

**how does the 5 principles align your experience**
i think some of my experience can demonstrate that i share the same values as the second, third, fourth principles. 

For the second one, where it promotes us to work collaboratively, regardless of background and experience. i have always had the experience working with a quite diverse workforce, whether in school projects or during internships. I believe everyone in the team is valuable and i value their experience working with me, so i have the ability to cater a technical concept to non technical audience, and i could always put myself in other's shoes, not to say something that could be provocative.

For the third principle, i have always been obsessed with my performance at work, while i work at Midas analytics, i would often go to the office on holidays or weekends to learn about new technologies or refactoring the codebase. I always cherish the time to improve myself and i have been pretty competitive as well, whether in school or career perspective! you can see that from the number of internships i obtained during my bachelor years! 

in terms of the 4th principle, i do have an ownership mentality over the work that i do. when i worked at Midas, i would constantly think about ways to improve the product outside of office hours, and my proactiveness and eagerness have encouraged the founder to give me equity of the company , given how much I cared for this product and the amount achievements i made for the firm!
