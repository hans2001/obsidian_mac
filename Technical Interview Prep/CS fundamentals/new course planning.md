### **Semester 3 (build the mental model)**
**CS 5400 — Principles of Programming Languages**
**CS 7600 — Intensive Computer Systems**
  
Why:
- 5400 teaches _how languages are defined and reasoned about_
- 7600 teaches _how systems are structured and analyzed_
- Both emphasize abstraction, semantics, and correctness
- Neither demands brutal implementation at the same time
    
This semester upgrades how you _think_, not just how you code.

### **Semester 4 (translation and execution)**
**CS 6410 — Compilers**
**CS 7610 — Building Scalable Distributed Systems** _(or 6650 if available)_

Why:
- Compilers builds on 5400 directly (semantics → IR → codegen)
- Distributed systems now makes sense because:
    - you understand OS internals
    - you understand system design trade-offs
    - you can reason about performance and failure
