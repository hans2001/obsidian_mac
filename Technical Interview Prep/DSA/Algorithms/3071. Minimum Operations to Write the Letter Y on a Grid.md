Problem: 
You are given a **0-indexed** `n x n` grid where `n` is odd, and `grid[r][c]` is `0`, `1`, or `2` We say that a cell belongs to the Letter **Y** if it belongs to one of the following:

- The diagonal starting at the top-left cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
- The diagonal starting at the top-right cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
- The vertical line starting at the center cell and ending at the bottom border of the grid.

The Letter **Y** is written on the grid if and only if:
- All values at cells belonging to the Y are equal.
- All values at cells not belonging to the Y are equal.
- The values at cells belonging to the Y are different from the values at cells not belonging to the Y.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to write the letter Y on the grid given that in one operation you can change the value at any cell to_ `0`_,_ `1`_,_ _or_ `2`_._

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/22/y2.png)

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,2],[1,1,0],[0,1,0]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can write Y on the grid by applying the changes highlighted in blue in the image above. After the operations, all cells that belong to Y, denoted in bold, have the same value of 1 while those that do not belong to Y are equal to 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed to write Y on the grid.

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/22/y3.png)

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,0,1,0],[2,1,0,1,2],[2,2,2,0,1],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,1,2,2,2]]
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** We can write Y on the grid by applying the changes highlighted in blue in the image above. After the operations, all cells that belong to Y, denoted in bold, have the same value of 0 while those that do not belong to Y are equal to 2. 
It can be shown that 12 is the minimum number of operations needed to write Y on the grid.

**Constraints:**
- `3 <= n <= 49`
- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2`
- `n` is odd.

Intuition:
first the color deployed by either side cannot be the same, we have to make sure that when we decide the value to deployed. and then we should find cells that belong or not belong to the grid, and use their size to compute the number of cells needed to be changed and helpful to set up the hashmap for both size!

Solution:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumOperationsToWriteY(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        mid = n // 2

        # Build the Y set: two diagonals from top to center, then a vertical stem down.
        belong = set()
        for r in range(mid):                 # top to (but not including) center row
            belong.add((r, r))               # left diagonal
            belong.add((r, n - 1 - r))       # right diagonal
        for r in range(mid, n):              # center row downwards (inclusive)
            belong.add((r, mid))

        # Count frequencies for Y and non-Y
        y_cnt = Counter()
        non_cnt = Counter()
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if (i, j) in belong:
                    y_cnt[grid[i][j]] += 1
                else:
                    non_cnt[grid[i][j]] += 1

        y_size = len(belong)
        non_size = n * n - y_size

        # Colors are integers (typically 0,1,2). Try all pairs a != b.
        colors = {0, 1, 2}  # If the problem guarantees only 0/1/2.
        best = float('inf')
        for a in colors:
            for b in colors:
                if a == b:
                    continue
                ops = (y_size - y_cnt[a]) + (non_size - non_cnt[b])
                if ops < best:
                    best = ops

        return best
```
