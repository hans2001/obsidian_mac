Problem: 
Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Motivation:
create 2 dictionary and create mappings on the run. Since len(s) == len(t) , whenever we encounter new one-to-one mapping that does not exist in both of the map. If we encounter a conflict of one-to-one mapping, one of the char is already mapped to another char, we return False.
