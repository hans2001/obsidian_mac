Problem: 
Given a 2D grid `grid` where `'1'` represents land and `'0'` represents water, count and return the number of islands.

An **island** is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically and is surrounded by water. You may assume water is surrounding the grid (i.e., all the edges are water).

Motivation:
track visited cell with a set or turn it to water! count the number of islands in the outer lp!

Solution:
DFS:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= ROWS or 
                c >= COLS or grid[r][c] == "0"
            ):
                return
                
            grid[r][c] = "0"
            for dr, dc in directions:
                dfs(r + dr, c + dc)

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    dfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1

        return islands
```

BFS:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0

        def bfs(r, c):
            q = deque()
            grid[r][c] = "0"
            q.append((r, c))

            while q:
                row, col = q.popleft()  
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = dr + row, dc + col
                    if (nr < 0 or nc < 0 or nr >= ROWS or
                        nc >= COLS or grid[nr][nc] == "0"
                    ):
                        continue
                    q.append((nr, nc))
                    grid[nr][nc] = "0"

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    bfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1

        return islands
```
