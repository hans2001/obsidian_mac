Problem: 
You are given a rectangular island `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The islands borders the **Pacific Ocean** from the top and left sides, and borders the **Atlantic Ocean** from the bottom and right sides.

Water can flow in **four directions** (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to a neighboring cell with **height equal or lower**. Water can also flow into the ocean from cells adjacent to the ocean.

Find all cells where water can flow from that cell to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Return it as a **2D list**where each element is a list `[r, c]` representing the row and column of the cell. You may return the answer in **any order**.

Motivation:
by pruning in the explore direction iterative loop, we dont need to pass in prevHeight, which is a required value for pruning, we can prune within the explore direction loop!
Brute force: run BFS on each cell to see if both border can be reach -> time complexity high.
Instead, use the idea from multi-source BFS, we run a reverse DFS from the border to reachable cells, and put them in the set. The intersection of cells in bot h set represents the answers! The time complexity reduce from O((m * n )^2) to O(m * n), since we visit each cell exactly once! 

Solution:
DFS:
```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ROWS, COLS = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        pac, atl = set(), set()

        def dfs(r, c, visit, prevHeight):
            if ((r, c) in visit or 
                r < 0 or c < 0 or 
                r == ROWS or c == COLS or 
                heights[r][c] < prevHeight
            ):
                return
            visit.add((r, c))
            dfs(r + 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r - 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c + 1, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c - 1, visit, heights[r][c])

        for c in range(COLS):
            dfs(0, c, pac, heights[0][c])
            dfs(ROWS - 1, c, atl, heights[ROWS - 1][c])

        for r in range(ROWS):
            dfs(r, 0, pac, heights[r][0])
            dfs(r, COLS - 1, atl, heights[r][COLS - 1])

        res = []
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if (r, c) in pac and (r, c) in atl:
                    res.append([r, c])
        return res
```
