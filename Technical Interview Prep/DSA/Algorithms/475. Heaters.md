Problem: 
Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 

Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return _the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses._

**Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

Intuition:
for binary search to work ,first we sort both arrays .then for each house ,we want to locate the nearest heater, so we try to insert this house into the heater array. 

By using binary search, we locate the index in heaters array that this house should be inserted into, without direct match, idx -1 will be the closest heater on the left handside of the house, and idx would be the right heater that is closest! we take the min of them and update the global radius if the min_dis is bigger! 


where are the inputs? 
this is greedy? 
figure out data members needed first,then u fill in the relevant method needed! 
he is using bisect sort, and u use that to determine if u should insert it in some place, there core  lib in c++  but i dont  remember the syntax! 
so u have the positions, but u dont knwo the optimal radisu for that, so u binary search on it! i dotn know about the input!why we sort bot h array ,assume what it gives is the index of house and heaters right, and we trying to 
for each house just check if the positon of this house falls within! 

```cpp
class template {

public: 
	template () {
		
	}
}
int main{ 
	# here u handle the input! 
}
```
