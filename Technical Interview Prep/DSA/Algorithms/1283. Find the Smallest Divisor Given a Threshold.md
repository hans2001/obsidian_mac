Problem: 
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the **smallest**`divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2). 

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5
**Output:** 44

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `nums.length <= threshold <= 106`

Constraints:

Intuition:
the value of divisor is inversely propoertional to the quotient ,so proportional  to the sum of all quotient, therefore we can use binary search in this case
use variable ans to record valid answr ,and left right pointer to probe potential solutions. 

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDivisor(self, nums: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        
        # Return the sum of division results with 'divisor'.
        def find_division_sum(divisor: int) -> int:
            result = 0
            for num in nums:
                result += ceil((1.0 * num) / divisor)
            return result
        
        ans = -1
        low = 1
        high = max(nums)
        
        # Iterate using binary search on all divisors.
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            result = find_division_sum(mid)
            # If current divisor does not exceed threshold, 
            # then it can be our answer, but also try smaller divisors
            # thus change search space to left half.
            if result <= threshold:
                ans = mid
                high = mid - 1
            # Otherwise, we need a bigger divisor to reduce the result sum
            # thus change search space to right half.
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        
        return ans
```
