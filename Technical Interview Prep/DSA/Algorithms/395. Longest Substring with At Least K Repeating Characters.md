Problem: 
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.

Intuition:
use the char that has less occurrence than k as the partition point! think about the decision tree that the function creates! 

Solution:
sliding window: 

divide and conquer: 
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution(object):
	def longestSubstring(self, s, k):
		if len (s ) < k :
			return 0
		d = Counter( s )
		for ch in s:
			if d[ch] >= k:
				continue
			max_len = 0
			for substring in s.split( ch ) :
				max_len = max ( self.longestSubstring ( substring, k) , max_len)
			return max_len
		return len( s )
```
