Problem: 
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `candies`. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of **sub piles**, but you **cannot** merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer `k`. You should allocate piles of candies to `k` children such that each child gets the **same** number of candies. Each child can be allocated candies from **only one** pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return _the **maximum number of candies** each child can get._

**Example 1:**
**Input:** candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** candies = [2,5], k = 11
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= candies.length <= 105`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 107`
- `1 <= k <= 1012`

Intuition:
each child can get a subpile of candies, and this subpile cannot aggreagte from pile, therefore we should find the max number for this subpile ot be distributed to the k number of students! 

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumCandies(self, candies: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Each student can only receive candies from a single pile.
        We binary search on the maximum number of candies per student.
        For a guess `mid`, we compute how many students we can serve by:
            sum(pile // mid for pile in candies)
        If we can serve at least `k` students, try a bigger `mid`.
        Otherwise, try a smaller one.
        """
        left, right = 1, max(candies)
        result = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = 0

            for pile in candies:
                count += pile // mid

            if count >= k:
                # mid works, try larger
                result = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                # mid too large, try smaller
                right = mid - 1

        return result
```
