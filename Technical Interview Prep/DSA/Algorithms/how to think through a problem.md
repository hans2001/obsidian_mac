**Overall, just make sure you are always thinking new ideas and repeatedly combining old observations to make new ones.** 

But for some more direct tips, try going through the following checklist when approaching a problem:

1. look at everything from perspective of binary and graph
    
2. think how information you have can be reused (like dp but more general)
    
3. reduce things to as simple as possible, get rid of redundant transitions/states/etc., resolve same and induct
    
4. make formulas out of everything, expand/rewrite as many ways possible
    
5. visualize everything, draw things out
    
6. look for structures like montonicity, concavity, etc., and do this for every part of problem, whether specific part or entire structure of solution
    
7. go through testcases by hand, maybe also make generator/brute force checker if stuck to further look for patterns
    
8. don't think same things over and over, write down everything you think and try to always write down new ideas, every small new observation is progress and may be able to be combined with other ideas eventually, but rethinking same things will not help
    
9. think of simplified cases or imagine assuming something you wish exists already exists and solving from there, chances are thing then does exist if helps
    
10. almost always a nice easily proveable solution
    
11. reverse/change ordering of process or look at inverse or just view problem in different way in general
    
12. if something reminds you of standard algorithm, think of every way you know how to do that standard thing and see if any modification relates to what you are doing
    
13. if something seems random in statement like any abnormal constraint or is similar to known problem but different in some way, is probably key to solving so consider why it is put in statement
    
14. don't forget sometimes can brute force small choices or if too many choices can pick random one or something that stands out (like max/min)
    
15. don't overcomplicate. try multiple directions, if too many steps or edge cases probably not right direction
    
16. restate problem/conditions in as many different ways as you can to get new perspectives
    
17. believe you can solve every problem, but also treat every problem as a challenge that you take one step at a time. even most standard ideas you can learn on your own if you treat same way as any other problem.
    
18. if something you remember very vaguely seems similar but you don't remember source and barely remember details, don't waste time trying to remember old thing, just start resolving from scratch
    
19. Sometimes can try to cheese with random/heuristic if running out of time. Especially true for OI contests with subtasks.
