Problem: 
You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with **bi-directional** roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.

Return _the **number of ways** you can arrive at your destination in the **shortest amount of time**_. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/02/14/1976_corrected.png)

**Input:** n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:
- 0 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, roads = [[1,0,10]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.

Intuition:
First we build the edges as usual and initialize value for the source node. then we relax edges in a order of Dijkstra, to find shortest time to reach each node ,and we can compute number of ways for each node along the way

Key logic: 
Given he greedy nature of Dijkstra, when we process node v coming form node u, dist[u] and ways[u] has been finalized. so if given a path where the time for this path reaching node v is smaller, we could replace number of ways to reach node v to ways[u], as ways [u] and dist[u] has bee finalized and correct!, and no divergent has happened yet! 

On the other hand, if we encounter a new or same edge that relaxed to node v, where time taken is the same as dist[v], that mean there is additional path with same weight that can reach node v, so we should increment ways[v]

Solution:
Dijkstra
```python
class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, n: int, roads: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 1_000_000_007

        # Build adjacency list
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for start_node, end_node, travel_time in roads:
            graph[start_node].append((end_node, travel_time))
            graph[end_node].append((start_node, travel_time))

        # Min-Heap (priority queue) for Dijkstra
        min_heap = [(0, 0)]  # (time, node)
        # Store shortest time to each node
        shortest_time = [float("inf")] * n
        # Number of ways to reach each node in shortest time
        path_count = [0] * n

        shortest_time[0] = 0  # Distance to source is 0
        path_count[0] = 1  # 1 way to reach node 0

        while min_heap:
            curr_time, curr_node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            # Skip outdated distances
            if curr_time > shortest_time[curr_node]:
                continue

            for neighbor_node, road_time in graph[curr_node]:
                # Found a new shortest path → Update shortest time and reset path count
                if curr_time + road_time < shortest_time[neighbor_node]:
                    shortest_time[neighbor_node] = curr_time + road_time
                    path_count[neighbor_node] = path_count[curr_node]
                    heapq.heappush(
                        min_heap, (shortest_time[neighbor_node], neighbor_node)
                    )

                # Found another way with the same shortest time → Add to path count
                elif curr_time + road_time == shortest_time[neighbor_node]:
                    path_count[neighbor_node] = (
                        path_count[neighbor_node] + path_count[curr_node]
                    ) % MOD

        return path_count[n - 1]
```

Complexity:
Time:
O(E) + O(ElogE)
Building the adjacency list takes O(E) time, since we iterate over all the edges once.

The main part of the algorithm is Dijkstra’s algorithm using a min-heap. In this implementation, a node can be added to the heap multiple times (if a shorter path to it is found later). For each edge, we may perform a heap insertion, and the heap can grow up to size O(E) in the worst case. Each insertion or extraction from the heap takes O(logE) time. Thus, the total time spent on heap operations is O(ElogE).

Space:
O(N + E)
The adjacency list stores O(2⋅E) edges, but it requires O(N+2E)≈O(N+E) space in total, as it also includes the N nodes in the outer list. The priority queue stores at most O(N) elements at any time. Additionally, the `shortestTime` and `pathCount` arrays require O(N) space. Since the total space used is dominated by O(N+E) for storing the graph, the overall space complexity is O(N+E).
