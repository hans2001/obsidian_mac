Problem: 
Given the `root` of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the **sum of all its cousins' values**.

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

Return _the_ `root` _of the modified tree_.

**Note** that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/example11.png)

**Input:** root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]
**Output:** [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.
- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/11/diagram33.png)

**Input:** root = [3,1,2]
**Output:** [0,0,0]
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.
- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.
- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 104`

Intuition:
the new sum should be val from cousin node without neighboring node, so u can compute child node value at parent node! with a hahsmap that contains the level sm


Solution:
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def replaceValueInTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None

        # First BFS: compute sum of values at each level
        level_sum = defaultdict(int)
        q = deque([root])
        level = 0

        while q:
            curr_sum = 0
            level_size = len(q)

            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = q.popleft()
                curr_sum += node.val

                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)

            level_sum[level] = curr_sum
            level += 1

        # Second BFS: update node values
        root.val = 0
        q = deque([root])
        curr_level = 0

        while q:
            level_size = len(q)

            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = q.popleft()

                left_val = node.left.val if node.left else 0
                right_val = node.right.val if node.right else 0
                sibling_sum = left_val + right_val

                next_level_sum = level_sum[curr_level + 1]

                if node.left:
                    node.left.val = next_level_sum - sibling_sum
                    q.append(node.left)

                if node.right:
                    node.right.val = next_level_sum - sibling_sum
                    q.append(node.right)

            curr_level += 1

        return root
```
