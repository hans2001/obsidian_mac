Problem: 
You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

An array capped by value x is obtained by replacing every element nums[i] with min(nums[i], x).

For each integer x from 1 to n, determine whether it is possible to choose a subsequence from the array capped by x such that the sum of the chosen elements is exactly k.

Return a 0-indexed boolean array answer of size n, where answer[i] is true if it is possible when using x = i + 1, and false otherwise.

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,4], k = 5
Output: [false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
For x = 1, the capped array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, so it is impossible to form a sum of 5.
For x = 2, the capped array is [2, 2, 2, 2]. Possible sums are 2, 4, 6, 8, so it is impossible to form a sum of 5.
For x = 3, the capped array is [3, 3, 2, 3]. A subsequence [2, 3] sums to 5, so it is possible.
For x = 4, the capped array is [4, 3, 2, 4]. A subsequence [3, 2] sums to 5, so it is possible.

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
Explanation:
For every value of x, it is always possible to select a subsequence from the capped array that sums exactly to 3.

Constraints:
	1 <= n == nums.length <= 4000
	1 <= nums[i] <= n
	1 <= k <= 4000©leetcode

Intuition:
Exactly 👍 You’ve got it — the integer `dp` is basically a **bitmask** where each bit represents “is this sum possible?”.

Solution:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def subsequenceSumAfterCapping(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[bool]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = [False] * n
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            dp = 1  # bit 0 is set: sum 0 achievable
            total = 0
            # Build dp with capped values; prune to k to keep ints small
            for num in nums:
                a = num if num <= x else x
                total += a
                dp |= (dp << a)
                if (dp >> k) & 1:  # early exit if we can already make k
                    ans[x - 1] = True
                    break
                if total > k:
                    dp &= (1 << (k + 1)) - 1
            else:
                # If we didn’t break early, check final reachability (also handles total < k)
                ans[x - 1] = ((dp >> k) & 1) == 1
        return ans

```
