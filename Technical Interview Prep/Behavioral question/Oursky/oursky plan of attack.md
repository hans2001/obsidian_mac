issues: 
1. **Support Ticket #127**: "Our accounting team just called. They're experiencing system lockups when multiple people use the inventory lookup tool simultaneously. According to Jane: 'Whenever I search for an item while Bob is already searching, my screen just freezes until he finishes. We're losing valuable time during month-end closing.'"

simultaneous inventory lookup
