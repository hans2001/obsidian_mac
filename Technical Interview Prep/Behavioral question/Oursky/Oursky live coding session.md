## Tickets: 
1. **Support Ticket #127**: "Our accounting team just called. They're experiencing system lockups when multiple people use the inventory lookup tool simultaneously. According to Jane: 'Whenever I search for an item while Bob is already searching, my screen just freezes until he finishes. We're losing valuable time during month-end closing.'"

understand that the dogpile effect relates to the cache setup, and instantly identify keywords and documentation that i should consult to, and have the mindset that minimum changes should be done ( given that i fully understand the problem, should talk to the interviewer here to verify! )

2. **Support Ticket #143**: "Urgent from retail location #12: After yesterday's power outage, their system rebooted but certain product lookups never complete - just endless loading. Manager reports they can't process returns for these items and customers are getting frustrated. Need immediate resolution."
