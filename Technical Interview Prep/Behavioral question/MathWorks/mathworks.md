"From what I understand, the EDG program is rotational program that allow members to have the flexibility to identify and explore areas of interest, and we will gain experience with MathWorks products and user workflows by directly interacting with our customers

I’m drawn to EDG because it feels like working as an founder of a startup, where despite building the product, we have to actually talked to the customer and gain user feedback firsthand, i believe this experience is valuable an will give us insights into how we can better our product. Moreover, i have the freedom to work towards my area of interest, and explore the various perspectives of math works before making a team match ,i think this is a huge privilege to have, and i am able to work towards my career path much easier.

	"My favorite projects  was the on i worked on during my bachelor studies at HKUST, where I worked on designing a low-power SRAM chip for IOT applications .
	
	The goal is to reduce leakage current and improve power efficiency without sacrificing data retention. To come up with a reliable design, we have to constantly test our component against voltage and current, and watch how it behaves accordingly!  the traditional way is doing this is to tweak configuration manually for each component, and run the preset tests in cadence virtuoso, and verify our result by observing the graph generated!

	However, this process takes way too long and we cannot afford to do that given our heavy workload during the semesters. what I identify is that we could write Matlab scripts to automate the process. So I generalize the tests that was performed, I extract the common parts to several Matlab scripts and use JSON to store variables ,all the scripts will be ran synchronously against a new design for an electronic component, and we turn the result to from graph-based to benchmark comparison, and this new process save us a lot of time and cognitive load
	
	This project highlighted a combination of engineering understanding and programming capability that I possess. I’ve seen firsthand how MATLAB can bridge theory and real-world validation, and I know those skills will allow me to provide strong technical support and solve complex problems for MathWorks customers."


3. authorized to work, activate CPT for work ,which is sponsored by the school.  I do need sponsorship in the future, to be more specific: H1B and my **OPT (Optional Practical Training)** eligibility would start **after graduation in May 2027**
