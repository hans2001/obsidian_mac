1. **Tell me about yourself**
Hi, My name is Hans, I recently obtained Bachelor's in Electronic Engineering with a minor in information technology at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University

Experience Overview  
Currently, I have around 4 years of software development experience, primarily centered around
- JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python
- Familiar with full stack development
- Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure
- and have experience with both SQL databases like MySQL and NoSQL solutions

My internship experience spans 4 industries: (optional) financial, transportation, telecommunication, and EdTech. Throughout these roles, I've built SaaS platforms, mobile applications, AI-powered systems, and Windows desktop application

My career began at startups like Midas Analytics, where I led the development of their flagship product , which is a  market intelligence web platform handling millions of financial records, in total secured more than $100k usd in funding. At Midas, i worked with large scale systems and massive data volume, where i have to query and process millions of data and deliver to the end user through visualization. I worked with technologies such as load balancer, virtualization, Concurrent fetching and Content Delivery Network

I later transitioned to large corporations, like CICC, where I developed a real-time monitoring dashboard with technologies such as [Vue.js](http://vue.js/) and Node.js for Bloomberg data usages. Most recently, I worked at Hong Kong Telecom, where i help built their Internal Genai Chat Asistant platform, using technologies such as Langchain, OpenAI SDK and more

I have always been interested in optimizing systems that handles massive data volume, and i believe i can do that here in the trade desk. I am also interested in learning more about advertising technology, how can it empower marketer to deliver more spot on marketing campaign. that is why i chose to apply for this role!

2. **Why do you want to work at this company?**

I always had a strong interest for the advertising industry, and from my perspective, i think the most important part of building a business is marking and product development, that is why i believe TTD create massive value for business around the world. What is more, from the job description, i notice that TTD is handling data in huge capacity in  a daily basis. I am a huge fan of system optimization, i would be very interested in working with  optimizing system performance to handle this volume of data, whether through caching or concurrency technique. and finally, i heard there is a one to one mentorship that will be provided to interns, and i think this would be a great place to start my career

3. **What are your strengths and weaknesses?**

Strengths:  **perform well under pressure**
had multiple ongoing project as CICC, one is the frontend development for the Derivative evaluation engine, and the other one is the monitoring dashboard for Bloomberg services. Even though the workload is high, I would strategize my plan to work through it. First,  i would come up with a clear timeline of deliverables with my supervisor at both ends ,and i make sure i prioritize tasks that would take the most time and those which are closer to the deadline. Moreover, I would keep my supervisor updated of my progress and manager their expectation properly.

Weakness: **Obsession to detail**
Sometimes i would spent more time that needed on refactoring tasks, because i have a genuine interest in refactoring code, and i enjoy spending time learning and exploring ways to solve difficult problems. however, this would sometime hinder the development progress, and i have to redirect my focus back to the ongoing feature development. 

4. **Tell me about an experience when you made a mistake and how you fixed it?**

When i interned at hong kong telecom, i worked in a team of 3 to to build a internal chat assistant platform for the firm, just like Chatgpt. the supervisor want us to embed the all the latest LLM technologies that can be found, such as image generation, code interpreter and audio to text.. First we think it is better build form scratch ,so we have a better understanding of things, so in the long run, we can build much faster, not to mention we can vibe code to speed things up. 
While it is not a bad idea, but it turns out we dont have that much time,  the development pace does not match expectations, and the supervisor want us to showcase this at the end of the month, and also integrate a few things that was developed by the firm, to showcase this product's potential. 
we know we are never going to make it given the current pace, so i did more research into the community, and i found that there are a few open source project that did very similar things comapre to us, os i suggest we pivot and adopt some of the code form the project, so that our product can look mature , and we focus on the most important feature instead!!
we did that and we able to deliver the platform on time and presented it to vice presidents across multiple departments, they were impressed by our progress, now the project is still ongoing, I would I demonstrate its potential and lay down a strong foundation for it!!


5. **What are the three things you wish to see in the firm you are working for?**

- **Growth opportunities** – training, mentorship, and career development.
- **Collaborative culture** – supportive colleagues, teamwork, and respect.
- **Innovation & impact** – meaningful projects where your contributions matter.

5. **Where do you see yourself in 3 years/5 years/10 years?**

i see myself working as junior software developer ,learning as much as i can about the trick of the trade. then in 5 years, i would like have the skillset required to be a senior software developer, and potentially I would hold leadership position where i could deliver artechicutre design and help the team members grow . in 10 years, I aspire to be in management positions, where I would code less, but focus on nurturing young talents at the firm, which i believe that is the way to deliver a much biger  long lasting impact to the firm

7. **Tell me about anything else which you have done or you are proud of but it is not in your resume?**

I am proud that i served USTHING as a technical lead for several years. This organization is a non profit software company ,where we build software that improves student's campus life, some of our feature includes grade checker, facilities booking, UST directory and UST Source. UST source is a project that was initiated by me, where the product allow students to share academic materials, and other student would need to consume tokens in order to view them. The reason why i initiated this is that i think there are not enough transparency for some of the courses, and the product encourage student to learn more about the topic, not limited by resource that was offered at their specific term. The project gained a lot of tractions, but it was still under development before i leave, and i think they are going to release it soon. My role:...

8. **What are your expectations from the company or colleagues?**

i know TTD holds a very high bar when it comes to recruiting engineers, I know that my colleagues will be smart and hard working, and i would be able to learn a lot from them. I also wish that the company give us more exposure to various aspects of the firm, and we are given tasks that solve real business problem instead of toy projects, I believe in my ability to deliver high quality code!

9. **Do you have any questions for us?**

i would like to know about the structure of the whole interview process and what would be a typical day for a SDE intern at the firm
