[[AWS breakdown]]
# Self intro: 
Hi, My name is Hans, I am currently pursuing a masters degree in computer science at Northeastern, and I obtained my Bachelor's from HKUST. 

I will do a brief summarization on why i think I am a great fit for the role. First i know that Jeffries encourages a culture  of flat and entrepreneurial sprit. i have great track record woking at startup such as SOCIF and Midas Analytics, where i was key contributor to their flagship product, and i deliver real business impact with clean and maintainable code from day one. I hold a strong ownership to every product I have worked on, and i would often go the extra mile to outwork our competitors. for example, i was given so much freedom to design and build the media intelligence SaaS at Midas, I decided to take on part time roles during semesters to continually grinding on the product with full time members. that demonstrates my ownership mentality and the ability to perform under pressure

Second, while being an expert in FullStack development, I do have a lot more exposure to infrastructure and DevOps compared to a standard developer.

to name a few, I was responsible for setting Devops pipeline and deployment procedures at Midas and hong kong Telecom. At Midas, I deployed in the traditional way where i spin up EC2 instances, load balancers and process managers, and utilized cloud service such as S3 bucket and Cloudfront to improve reliability and availability infrastructure wise. At Hong Kong Telecom, i configured the docker network to bypass the regional restrictions imposed on Hong Kong, and setup pipelines to ensure continus integration and on-prem deployment went as smooth as possible!

Last but not least, i know that Jeffries are actively adopting technologies in the GenAI space, given my background working with Agentic applications at both HKT and HKUST, and my experiences working at a leading Chinese investment bank. I believe i can integrate seamlessly into the team and deliver impact from day one.

. **Do you have any questions for us?**
- _How does the Asia IT team contribute to Jefferies’ global technology strategy_
- how much effort does Jefferies are devoting into embracing genai technologies, can i expect to work with the latest technologies when i join the firm as full time analyst, or i will be mainly maintaining traditional services
