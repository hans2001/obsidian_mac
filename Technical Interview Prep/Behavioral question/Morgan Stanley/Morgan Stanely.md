## Hirevue questions (2 min or 30 sec to prep? )
**Why Morgan Stanley and what perspective do you bring to the team?**
morgan stanely : intersection of technology and finance, (enable me to build financial technologies: personal interest (internships in Hong Kong ), (fast pace development: low-latency focused: (trading platforms), huge advocate for building efficient systems and applications, i can find like minded people here)

major players in the market, ( deliver impact to millions of people ) (assist the creation of wealth, build internal tools that empower collegue in different departments, so that they can better help the clients to achieve what they want)

**Why do you think you can fit our team? / What would you be able to bring to this role?**
**Why do you see yourself working at our firm? / Why do you consider your self a good candidate for MS**
first thing first, i have a good foundation in computer knowledge such as databases.,operating systems and algorithms ,given my bachelor and masters background in computer science. 

Second, i had numerous internship in Hong Kong and the practical development experience i gained form those, is way beyond those US counterparts. especially my year long internship at Midas, where i lead teams to build commercial products and help the company to secure fundings and clients, i believe this is what differentiate me from other students. 

Moreover i have great track record of being technical leads, and i believe my technical expertise will help me excel at Morgan Stanely

**What is a feedback you received and how did you handle it?**
situation:
first internship, feedback i learn too slow -> CTO (not much experience with web dev)

task: identified the true reason: dabble into concepts too deep, which is not required to buidl the current application( driven by curiosity ) 

action: change my habit of learning, and adapt to the environemtn at the time
learn fast and build things fast( instead of learning all the details before building) 

result: finish the app in great shape within a month, CTO apprised me for my work, and ask me if i want to work part time!


**Describe a tech trend over the next 6-12 months**
given how competitive the market is, students are starting to crack online programming contests with the help from GenAI. they do so to gain a accredited rank on platforms such as leetcode and codeforces, and marking it as a personal milestone on their resume to make their profile more competitive. 

The trend gave rise to products such as cluely, which allow people to cheat on anything, including sales calls and technical interviews. while it has been controversial, it was well perceived by the public, i think that might gave rise to startups trying to encourage those kind of behaviour or prevent it 

**Explain 2 things about yourself that you didn't mention in your resume**
1. Usthing (student - led nonprofit organization that built software which improve campus life for students) ( feature such as facility booking, grade checking..)

role: technical Lead of Usthing
come up with technical arch design for codebases, led the software development cycle, 
worked with different teams( design, backend ) to push forward the project( share academic materials ), it was deployed and gained popularity among students

2. I was offered equity when i worked at Midas analytics (employee stock options)

role: build the flagship product from scratch
due to my excellent performance, the prototype helped the company raise millions of dollars and helped the company secured their first batch of clients
proudest moments of mine and proved that i am a great engineer

**Walk me through your resume**
I obtained Bachelor's in Electronic Engineering with a minor in computer science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and currently pursuing a masters in computer science at northeastern

Experience Overview  
currently, I have around 4 years of software development experience, primarily centered around
- JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python,C++
- Cloud platforms like AWS
- and have experience with both SQL databases like MySQL and NoSQL solutions

My internship experience spans 4 industries: (optional) financial, transportation, telecommunication, and EdTech. Throughout these roles, I've built SaaS platforms, mobile applications, AI-powered systems, and Windows desktop application

Career Journey  
My career began at startups like SOCIF and Midas, where I built flagship product such as market intelligence web platform handling millions of financial records, in total secured more than $100k usd in funding 

I later transitioned to large corporations, like CICC, where I developed a real-time monitoring dashboard with technologies such as Vue.js/ Node.js for Bloomberg data usages. Most recently, i interned at HKT, where I built an internal GenAI platform that interacts with LLM endpoints like OpenAI, Gemini, and Llama3, and utilized workflows to improve response accuracy using technologies such as LangChain and OPENAI SDK

**Why did you apply to this division?**  (technology? / enterprise engineering team)
I have always been a technologist and i believe that is the way i can contribute the best to morgan stanely. Moreover, I fulfilled most of the requirements on the job description, where i have a good comprehension of data structure and algorithms, my background in computer science gave me knowledge in database and scripting skills, and i can program in c++ well. That is exactly why i apply for the role 

**Tell me about when you handled a problem in a team / Give an example of when you worked in a team to achieve a goal**
During my time as Usthing, our team were required hustle a new feature to production. the feature is specifically designed for easter holiday and we have a strict deadline. 

The leader at the time decoupled the feature into multiple parts, and i was responsible for changing the image rendering method to using NextJs' native image component. 

so i created a branch for my part, did that and ran through couple unit test. Then i reiterated my branch based on his reviews, and finally he merged all the little parts.

At the end, the feature was a actual blast and we broke a new record of 100 + DAU

**Describe a time when you worked in a team and faced a challenge. How did you overcome it?**
**Situation:**
when i worked at CICC,  i have problem setting up my development environment, the Maven distributions I installed does not seem to be compatible to the codebase, and i have no idea why since i have little experience working with JAVA at the time. 

**Action:**
First, I try to solve the problem by reading the documentation provided by the team, but i did not found the specified version for that. Then, i asked my collegue for help, while he tried out couple methods on my computer, it does not seem to work, since he did not set up his development environment. Finally, i seeked help from my supervisor, and he successfully identified the issue and propose a fix for me to work on. 

**Result:**
the experience taught me the importance of seeking help from others, otherwise i would spent countless hours working on trivial issues, instead of contributing to the team 

**Define success and failure in your own words** 
success to me is that i achieved what i set out to do. and failure to me is basically the opposite of that, where i became lazy, did not stick through the process or gave up too quickly.
the reason why i have these as the definition of success is that i dont think comparing with others is smart, since everyone has their own talent, and sometimes you just not able to compete with them. However, i focus on self improvement, and set out goals that i know i can achieve with the right amount of effort and time. So if i did not reach the goal I set, it basically means i did not put enough effort in the process.

**How would you deal with a colleague who is not cooperating?** (give an example) 
i would first try to put myself into their shoes, maybe they are busy with other projects, or maybe this is against his interest. I would think about what incentives i could offer to him, so that he can be cooperative. 
if it does not work, i would resort to his or my supervisor and ask for help, 
my approach consist of both soft and hard measures,  which i think is necessary in order to push things forward.
