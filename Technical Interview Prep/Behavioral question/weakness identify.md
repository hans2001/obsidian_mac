dfs with trees
Dijkstra
topological sort
binary search on random things
computation involved problems! 
dp
greedy? 

coding practices
give a more  detailed plan and identify why failure ( for daily problems and weekly contest! )

i should have a excel table for better visualization 
can i have a dashboard for that as well? 
i dont want to do the data entry! 

ask gpt 

failed problem should be resolved? 
i should have a dashboard and attach with the link where it should be resolved ? so i dont have to manually record that! 
also attach the weekly contest link as well! and have the explanations and problem attach to it? or it can be just hte problem name and ...( by parsing the leetcode link? )

the db should deployed? where i can 


get your decoding pipeline:  (binary search)
	 what is the variable we’re binary searching on?
		
	- what is f(x)?
		
	- what is the monotone condition?
		
	- what’s low, what’s high?
