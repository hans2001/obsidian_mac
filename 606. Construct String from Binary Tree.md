Problem: 
Given the `root` node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Node Representation**: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.
    
- **Parentheses for Children**: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:
    
    - If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
    - If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.
- **Omitting Empty Parentheses**: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., `()`) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.
    
    In summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.
    
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons1-tree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** "1(2(4))(3)"
**Explanation:** Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/cons2-tree.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4]
**Output:** "1(2()(4))(3)"
**Explanation:** Almost the same as the first example, except the `()` after `2` is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for `2` and the presence of a right child.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

Intuition:
from example, we can observe that current node vla alwasy appear firs , it is obvious preorder sequence. we know that we should assign () for child ,where child value will be in the middle. and we can only do that when we are at the parent level !(child dont know it is child node) so during traversal, we build the string, can provide () if child node exist! 
exception: even left child node does not exist, we have to provide () if right child node exist! 

(invariants) only 4 condition to fulfill:
1. Leaf node → just print the value.
2. Left child exists → print (left).
3. Right child exists → print (right).
4. **Exception**: if right exists but left doesn’t, you **must** print () for the left so the right child doesn’t slide into the left slot.

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        def preorder(node):
            if not node:
                return ""

            s = str(node.val)

            # both children empty -> just value
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return s

            # right exists but left missing -> must include "()"
            if not node.left and node.right:
                return s + "()" + "(" + preorder(node.right) + ")"

            # left exists (right may or may not)
            s += "(" + preorder(node.left) + ")"
            if node.right:
                s += "(" + preorder(node.right) + ")"
            return s

        return preorder(root)
```
