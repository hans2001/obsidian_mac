Problem: 
We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing **common, positive-length free time** for _all_employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing `Intervals` in the form `[x, y]`, the objects inside are `Intervals`, not lists or arrays. For example, `schedule[0][0].start = 1`, `schedule[0][0].end = 2`, and `schedule[0][0][0]` is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
**Output:** [[3,4]]
**Explanation:** There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
**Output:** [[5,6],[7,9]]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50`
- `0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8`
- 
Constraints:

Intuition:
first flatten schedule  from multiple employee, then merge the flatten timelines to a singe interval arr. then any gap found would be the common free time

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def employeeFreeTime(self, schedule: '[[Interval]]') -> '[Interval]':
        # 1) Flatten
        flat = []
        for emp in schedule:
            for iv in emp:
                flat.append(iv)

        if not flat:
            return []

        # 2) Sort by start time
        flat.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)

        # 3) Merge overlaps into `merged`
        merged = [flat[0]]
        for iv in flat[1:]:               # <-- note flat[1:], not flat
            last = merged[-1]
            if iv.start <= last.end:      # merge if they overlap or touch
                last.end = max(last.end, iv.end)
            else:
                merged.append(iv)

        # 4) Collect the gaps BETWEEN merged busy intervals
        free = []
        for i in range(1, len(merged)):
            prev, curr = merged[i-1], merged[i]
            if curr.start > prev.end:
                free.append( Interval(prev.end, curr.start) )

        return free
