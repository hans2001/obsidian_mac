## Tell me about your passions and interests, and how they might help you succeed at UBS?
i have a passion for building low latency software，whatever project i worked on, i would constantly look for ways to optimize the performance of the software, since low latency will give a good experience to the user, and it is highly proportional to the user retention rate, so it is never a waste to do that. the financial industry often craves for low latency application, such as the system that trader execute trades on, or client facing tools that offer financial management. performance is always a major factor to consider during development. i believe my passion aligns well with the goal that shared among the group technology office ,and i believe this trait of me would allow me to blend in pretty well at UBS

## What was your most significant achievement in the last year? What did you do and what made your performance outstanding?
my most significant achievement last year is that i prepared the materials for master application in a short amount of time. after my graduation, i interned at a company for 3 months before i work full time on my application. most of the deadline applications are around december, which means i have less than 3 month to obtain good results in GRE, TOEFL, asking for recommendation letters and writing the statement of purpose for each school. normally, it would take people around a year to come up with all of that. in my case, i have to be a fast learner and study part time after work, 

## Give one example of a time when you had to quickly analyze a situation and make a quick decision.
during technical interviews, i have to quickly understand the problem and make a decision of what algorithm to use. in those moments, i would apply my pattern recognition skills, and break down problems into smaller ones, and think of ways to solve them one by one, this showcase by analytical thinking abilities and. in cases where i dot have much insights int o the situation, i would get more information about the situation before making a decision ,for example , i would ask the interviewer for constraints of the problems or any potential hint. it is important for us to seek help form others or locate more information if we are hesitant about our decision!

## Tell us about a time where you have come up with a new idea or new way of  doing something.
in my early career where i worked at a startup, we have so much work to do, but still we have to spend so much time creating this verbose documentation that record the technical details of our work. That is a time GENAI just came out, the best practice before is to adopt some kind of template that speed up and standardize the process, but i thought in terms of first principle , what if we could just auto generate the documentation based on our code, and therefore i discovered a vscode extension that allow me to do just that. not only my documentation workflow became way more effective, I even introduce it to the team, and our team became way more productive as a result

## If UBS would consider sponsoring another sport than F1 on a global level, what would it be and why?
i would suggest e-sports, it is one of the fastest -growing field , especially gaining popularities among younger generations, i combines technology, strategy and international competition, values that align well with ubs' innovative and global mindset. sponsoring e sports could connect UBS with a demographic that will be the next generation of investors and professionals.”

## Why UBS? (elaborate)
“What draws me to UBS is that it’s not just a top global bank, but one that puts technology right at the center of its strategy.
I really like how the Group Operations & Technology team pushes innovation — whether it’s using AI to improve client services or making internal processes more efficient. It feels like the kind of place where I can work on complex, meaningful projects with a global impact.” AI assistant( RED ) show that UBS is working with frontier technology, and care deeply about employee's growth
## A time have to change or adapt priorities / A time have to adapt your approach
when i worked at hong kong telecom, our team was tasked to develop the prototype for an multi-modal Chatgpt like platform. after careful planning ,we decided to build from scratch, in order to have a better grasp of the relevant concepts and a deeper understanding of the codebase. however, after the mid- term presentation, our supervisor was not happy with the progress, and suggest us to look into a few open source platform that does the similar thing. we later transition to build on top of one of the open source project, and give proper credit to it during the final presentation. The supervisor was happy with our progress and we gave the prototype presentation to multiple department head across the firm

## A time work in team to solve problems (rewrite in STAR principle)
when i worked at CICC,  i team up with my supervisor to build the frontend for one of the key project. before actual implementation, we would come up with the design documentation and implementation strategy ,tasks were distributed properly on the internal kanban dashboard, and i would verify my code logic with my supervisor verbally. after my portion of work is done, i would create a pull request for my supervisor to conduct code reviews, before integrating it to the actual product. the workflow prove to be a great way for me to work with others, and it constantly boost my productivity and performance of my team members!

## IT roles in global bank
in a global bank ,IT is the backbone that ensure secure, compliant and scalable operations, it support business growth by enabling reliable systems, integrating emerging technologies and ensure seamless cross border operations. i had the experience working in an investment bank, and my work created real business impacts for the firm, whether it is saving them thousands of dollars per month, or tools that allow traders to execute trade more efficiently,  it motivates me to continuously strive for the best when i build those technologies for the firm, and it is a meaningful position to be in!

## Most interesting technological development in your opinion.
it is apparently GenAI technologies. seeing how genai empowered laymen to write code for their ideas and product ,how they improved their understanding about the technological world, is amazing. i am not jealous of genai taking our programmer's job, but i believe in a place where genai automates those mudane tasks for us, so that we can focus on creativity and coming up with tools that can help people in real life much much faster. the idea of agent ,where we dont have to continuously prompt to get ai do things for us is  more fascinating in my opinion. i look forward to the future where this technology are seamlessly integrate into the workplace , especially curious about how the banking industry is going to work with this piece of technology

## Further comments
i have always been a huge fan of financial technology, from early stage where I worked at Midas to build tools that empower hedge fund and individual traders to locate market insights quickly, to my experience working in cicc(full name), where i build tools that empowers colleagues to perform immediate derivatives evaluation, and a dashboard that contribute to the firm's budgeting goal, the experience gave me so much insights on what technology can do for the financial industry, and i believe i can do much more after i join UBS

## why do u want to work for a bank
fan of fintech, interested about how it is design, how low latency is achieved, how the app we used everyday to manage our financial is built
banking is important aspect of life, manage our financials and huge up side in the stock market, empower laymen to share the benefit of that
the product we build has global  impact, and the ability to server the region of Hong Kong 

## what are you strengths and weakness

analytical thinking, break down complex problems  and find effective solutions, practice leetcode style questions, strengthen my problem solving skills, essential in financial industry 

strength2 :team work, collaborate well with others even worked as a leader

weakness: overly detailed oriented , spend too much time refactoring codebases, working on balancing both, i would set time limits for specific task , it allow me to maintain quality of my work and enhance productivity

## what  is your understanding of the role u are applying (IT roles in global bank) 
join as an intern in the group op and tech office
responsible for supporting, developing and implementing technology solutions, able to gain exposure to the banking technologies

key skills:
1. have to be a strategic thinker with good communication skill, which i do, where i have a have a lot of experiences working in team, in ternships or in shcoo p and i strategically apply for the internship here, cause i think internship at UBS is such as privilege thing to do, and would give a huge boost to my career

2. motivated to work with high demands and tight deadlines! have the exp working in startup where we have to push code to prod every week and with the rapid pace development cycles ,not only didi i performed well, i was offered equity at the firm, so i think i definitely have the ability to excel at UBS

## describe a sit where u had to influence or persuade others
at school project, i often have to convince people to accept my proposal and ideas, since it is natural to believe i can come up with the best solution, and  i can have more control over the grade i am going to get for the project. In those situations, i would showcase my confidence and charisma during the pitch, trying to gain the trust from my teammates. other than that, i would actively engage them in the brainstorming session and provide enough flexibility to let them feel good about the process. I would even put more effort in comparison to showcase that i have serious dedication to the project, and I strive to get good results for everyone, result: this approach often works, and i end up being the leader for the project and we can usually get the result that we wanted

## talk about a time u had a difficulty at work
key project behind schedule
took initiative for team meeting, identify root cause, pinpoint problems and revise the timeline (highlight your actions and talk about the result achieved) 
## how would u explain  a complex technical concept to manager ? 
I do have this sort of experience where I have to introduce the work I have done in my last internship to a hiring manager. The situation was obviously testing my communications skills, and what I did was to decouple the complex system I built to couple major components, and explain what each component does and how they are connected together. The method did gave clarity to the system i built, and i even utilize the STAR principle to explain the context of why we have to build that, what exactly i did and what kind of result my actions led to, and with the additional context, i believe the system can be understood quite intuitively, similar to how we connect difficult concepts to things we already know!
