Problem: 
You are given an integer n.

Return the largest prime number less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers starting from 2. If no such number exists, return 0

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 5 * 105

Intuition:
compute the list of primes up to n with **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, the idea is that we compute all multiples up to n for all numbers up to sqrt( n ) ( all multiple under n * n has already been computed) 

plain terms:
you assume every number is prime, then systematically cross out multiples of each 
prime starting from 2. What survives are the primes.

since the answer ask for sum of consecutive  prime number starting form 2 (even though 2 is not prime, the rest of tje prime used has to be consecutive)
therefore, u can just expand the window until the num is larger than n, but u only update the result when it is a prime number(cond)

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def largestPrime(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2:
            return 0

        def compute_primes():
            is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)
            is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False

            for p in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
                if is_prime[p]:
                    for m in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                        is_prime[m] = False

            return [i for i, prime in enumerate(is_prime) if prime]

        primes = compute_primes()
        prime_set = set(primes)

        cur_sum = 0
        ans = 0

        for p in primes:
            cur_sum += p
            if cur_sum > n:
                break
            if cur_sum in prime_set:
                ans = cur_sum

        return ans
```
