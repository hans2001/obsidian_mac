Problem: 
You are given a 2D integer array `edges` representing a tree with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, rooted at node `0`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` means there is an edge between the nodes `vi` and `ui`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `colors` of size `n`, where `colors[i]` is the color assigned to node `i`.

We want to find a node `v` such that every node in the subtree of `v` has the **same** color.

Return _the size of such subtree with the **maximum** number of nodes possible._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], colors = [1,1,2,3]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** Each color is represented as: 1 -> Red, 2 -> Green, 3 -> Blue. We can see that the subtree rooted at node 0 has children with different colors. Any other subtree is of the same color and has a size of 1. Hence, we return 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], colors = [1,1,1,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The whole tree has the same color, and the subtree rooted at node 0 has the most number of nodes which is 4. Hence, we return 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], colors = [1,2,3,3,3]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Each color is represented as: 1 -> Red, 2 -> Green, 3 -> Blue. We can see that the subtree rooted at node 0 has children with different colors. Any other subtree is of the same color, but the subtree rooted at node 2 has a size of 3 which is the maximum. Hence, we return 3.

Intuition:
build directed edge for the tree ,valid subtree with post-order traversal, and maintain the flag and size variable with a hash_map, at the end ,we update global size with only valid subtree size
