**How would you learn a new technology that you need to use for the job?**  
First I would make sure I understand the terminology that is used by this new technology, similar to how we learn a new language, we learn the vocabulary first before connecting things together. Then I would understand the core concepts that the technology introduced ,and finally I would get my hands dirty, where I actually use the technology to build something, so that I can have a more profound understanding of that, or know how we can practically use that in our project, instead of wasting time learning everything!

## Solve problem at scale
**Situation:** At **Midas Analytics**, I worked on a financial intelligence SaaS platform handling real-time market data.  
**Task:** Our system struggled with slow queries when processing millions of financial news records under concurrent load.  
**Action:** I redesigned the MongoDB data layer — replacing Mongoose with the native Node.js driver, optimizing protobuf schemas, and adding indexes + aggregation pipelines.  I also set up load balancing for backend servers, setup CDN for to server the frontend webpages globally, and ensure latency at the client side is low, I measured the performance with Lighthouse and Google analytics
**Result:** Query performance doubled under concurrent load, latency dropped significantly, and our product helped secure **$1M HKD funding** after multiple product iterations.

## Took ownership of a project:
**Situation:** At **HKT Innovation Lab**, I interned on a project to build an internal GenAI platform.  
**Task:** I was tasked to design scalable workflows and APIs that 20+ internal teams could use securely.  
**Action:** I built modular LLM workflows with LangChain, RESTful APIs for RAG document workflows, and automated CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions.  
**Result:** The platform reduced lookup time by **40%**, improved answer accuracy by **35%**, and supported 20+ teams across the company with secure access to AI.


**Describe a time you worked on a diverse or global team.**
**Situation:** At **HKUST**, I led a research project in the Theoretical & Computational Chemistry Lab.  
**Task:** I was the tech lead building a 3D virtual classroom with multimodal AI and real-time networking.  
**Action:** I collaborated with professors, designers, and engineers from different backgrounds (chemistry, education, computer science) and integrated voice input, avatars, and VR support.  
**Result:** The project secured **$250K HKD in funding** from the Center for Education Innovation, and supported over 100 concurrent users in real-time.


**Tell me about when you handled a problem in a team / Give an example of when you worked in a team to achieve a goal**  
During my time at Usthing, our team was required to hustle a new feature to production. The feature is specifically designed for the easter holiday and we have a strict deadline. 

The leader at the time decoupled the feature into multiple parts, and I was responsible for changing the image rendering method to using NextJs' native image component. 

So I created a branch for my part, did that, and ran through a couple of unit tests. Then I reiterated my branch based on his reviews, and finally, he merged all the little parts.

In the end, the feature was an actual blast and we broke a new record of 100 + DAU.


**Describe a time when you worked in a team and faced a challenge. How did you overcome it?**  
When I worked at CICC,  I had problems setting up my development environment, the Maven distributions I installed did not seem to be compatible with the codebase, and I have no idea why since I have little experience working with JAVA at the time. 

First, I tried to solve the problem by reading the documentation provided by the team, but i did not find the specified version for that. Then, I asked my colleague for help, while he tried out a couple of methods on my computer, it did not seem to work, since he had not set up his development environment. Finally, I sought help from my supervisor, and he successfully identified the issue and proposed a fix for me to work on. 

The experience taught me the importance of seeking help from others, otherwise, I would spent countless hours working on trivial issues, instead of contributing to the team.


**Why do you see yourself working at our firm? / Why do you consider yourself a good candidate for TTD**
First things first, I have a good foundation in computer knowledge such as databases., operating systems, and algorithms, given my bachelor's and master's background in computer science. 

Second, I had numerous internships in Hong Kong and the practical development experience i gained from those, is way beyond those US counterparts. Especially my year-long internship at Midas, where I lead teams to build commercial products and help the company to secure fundings and clients, i believe this is what differentiates me from other students. 

Moreover, I have a great track record of being a technical lead, and I believe my technical expertise will help me excel at TTD


**Name a time you overcame adversity**
During my first internship, I was tasked with building a mobile app using the framework react-ionic. Even though I have fundamentals in programming, I have little experience on the type of tools and practice that was used by the industry, so the amount of knowledge to consume at the time was overwhelming . To make it worse, the CTO expects me to deliver an unreasonable amount of code each day, which makes me more nervous and I could not learn properly! 

What I did to overcome this adversity is that I had a conversation with the CTO, telling him that I need more time to pick up things properly at the initial phase, and I promised him that I will pick up the pace and put us back on track later.  Even though he was in doubt, he did carve out a period where I can focus more on learning and understanding the codebase. In the end, I managed to deliver as I promised, he was satisfied with the result, and even invited me to be a part time employee.
