Problem: 
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `'/'`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its **simplified canonical path**.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

- A single period `'.'` represents the current directory.
- A double period `'..'` represents the previous/parent directory.
- Multiple consecutive slashes such as `'//'` and `'///'` are treated as a single slash `'/'`.
- Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, `'...'` and `'....'` are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

- The path must start with a single slash `'/'`.
- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `'/'`.
- The path must not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it is the root directory.
- The path must not have any single or double periods (`'.'` and `'..'`) used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the **simplified canonical path**.

Intuition:
use stack to store dirs, later connect them
skip empty dir name
pop stack when double period is found
join the stack with slash at the end

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        paths = path.split("/")

        for cur in paths:
            if cur == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            elif cur != "" and cur != ".":
                stack.append(cur)

        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
