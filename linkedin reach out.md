Hi Padmanabhan,

I hope you’re doing well! As a fellow HKUST alum, I was really impressed by what you’ve built at EzDubs. I have 4 years of software development experience and have built a real-time speech translation system using OpenAI Whisper in one of my previous roles. I'm currently exploring opportunities in software engineering—would your team be open to an intern or any kind of project-based help?

I’d be happy to talk more about how I could contribute.

Best regards, 
Hans

**Hi Donovan,**

I hope you’re doing well. I came across your profile and saw your work at Fintool—very impressive! I’m currently seeking a Software Engineering internship and was wondering if your team is open to interns. If so, would you be willing to refer me for a role at your company? I’d be happy to share my resume and background for your reference.

Thanks for your time, and I appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,  
Hans

**Hi Ace,**  
I noticed we’re both HKUST alumni and was impressed by your background in AI and robotics, now at xAI. I’d love to connect.

Best,
