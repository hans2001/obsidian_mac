## Thoughts

- Working towards post-graduate degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, or equivalent practical experience.  Exceptional undergraduates will also be considered.
- Experience with Matlab, R, Julia, or Python.
- Experience with Generative AI models (Open AI, Hugging Face, Anthropic)
- Experience with numerical packages such as NumPy or BLAS/LAPACK.
- Experience with Machine Learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Experience with low-level languages such as C, C++, Rust or Go.
- Quantitative and modeling skills with an ability to learn techniques in numerical optimization, data mining, Monte Carlo simulation, or model calibration.
- Open-source development projects.
- Contributions to the local developer community.

i would get familiar with that after i practice with the cses problem set, then i am more comfortable to use it in projects? 
but mostly  focus on my learnings and understanding

practice doing virtual contest with c++
