## TODO

- [ ] job application
- [ ] gym 
- [ ] then work on the proj ! 
- [ ] neetcode 
	- [ ] backtracking
	- [ ] tries! 

## Thoughts

i sho do more backtracking, heap matter less? 
should do more pattern composition type problem! 
dont need tries?
finish heap problems
or do more tree problems? 
heap is fake hard! 

i used to be good before! 
now i lost the vibe! what should i do?
what happened., i would say this is temporary( lost of touch! ), try to problem solve yourself again and think clearly on the simple cases and edge cases (mental model!)
